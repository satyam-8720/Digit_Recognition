# Handwritten Digit Recognition 🧠✍️

This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Recognition** system using machine learning techniques, possibly leveraging the MNIST dataset. The system is designed to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using image data.

## 📚 Project Contents

- `hand_written.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations.

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common ML libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow` or `scikit-learn`, etc.

You can install required packages via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook hand_written.ipynb
```

3. Run all cells and follow along with the output.
